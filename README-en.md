## Voice Synthesis üó£

A list of all supported voices can be viewed here: [Voice List](./docs/voice-list.txt)

2024-04-16 v1.1.2 Added 9 new Azure voice synthesis voices that require API KEY configuration. These voices sound more realistic.

## Subtitle Generation üìú

Currently, there are 2 ways to generate subtitles:

- **edge**: Faster generation speed, better performance, no specific requirements for computer configuration, but the
  quality may be unstable
- **whisper**: Slower generation speed, poorer performance, specific requirements for computer configuration, but more
  reliable quality

You can switch between them by modifying the `subtitle_provider` in the `config.toml` configuration file

It is recommended to use `edge` mode, and switch to `whisper` mode if the quality of the subtitles generated is not
satisfactory.

> Note:
>
> 1. In whisper mode, you need to download a model file from HuggingFace, about 3GB in size, please ensure good internet connectivity
> 2. If left blank, it means no subtitles will be generated.

> Since HuggingFace is not accessible in China, you can use the following methods to download the `whisper-large-v3` model file

Download links:

- Baidu Netdisk: https://pan.baidu.com/s/11h3Q6tsDtjQKTjUu3sc5cA?pwd=xjs9
- Quark Netdisk: https://pan.quark.cn/s/3ee3d991d64b

After downloading the model, extract it and place the entire directory in `.\MoneyPrinterTurbo\models`,
The final file path should look like this: `.\MoneyPrinterTurbo\models\whisper-large-v3`

```
MoneyPrinterTurbo
  ‚îú‚îÄmodels
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄwhisper-large-v3
  ‚îÇ          config.json

> The current project includes some default music from YouTube videos. If there are copyright issues, please delete
> them.

## Subtitle Fonts üÖ∞

Fonts for rendering video subtitles are located in the project's `resource/fonts` directory, and you can also add your
own fonts.

## Common Questions ü§î

### ‚ùìHow to Use the Free OpenAI GPT-3.5 Model?

[OpenAI has announced that ChatGPT with 3.5 is now free](https://openai.com/blog/start-using-chatgpt-instantly), and
developers have wrapped it into an API for direct usage.

**Ensure you have Docker installed and running**. Execute the following command to start the Docker service:

```shell
docker run -p 3040:3040 missuo/freegpt35
```

Once successfully started, modify the `config.toml` configuration as follows:

- Set `llm_provider` to `openai`
- Fill in `openai_api_key` with any value, for example, '123456'
- Change `openai_base_url` to `http://localhost:3040/v1/`
- Set `openai_model_name` to `gpt-3.5-turbo`

> Note: This method may be unstable

### ‚ùìAttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'choices'

This issue is caused by the large language model not returning a correct response.

It's likely a network issue. Use a **VPN**, or set `openai_base_url` to your proxy, which should solve the problem.

At the same time, it is recommended to use **Moonshot** or **DeepSeek** as the large model provider, as these service providers have faster access and are more stable in China.

### ‚ùìRuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found

Normally, ffmpeg will be automatically downloaded and detected.
However, if your environment has issues preventing automatic downloads, you may encounter the following error:

```
RuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found.
Install ffmpeg on your system, or set the IMAGEIO_FFMPEG_EXE environment variable.
```

In this case, you can download ffmpeg from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/, unzip it, and set `ffmpeg_path` to your
actual installation path.

```toml
[app]
# Please set according to your actual path, note that Windows path separators are \\
ffmpeg_path = "C:\\Users\\harry\\Downloads\\ffmpeg.exe"
```

### ‚ùìError generating audio or downloading videos

[issue 56](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/56)

```
failed to generate audio, maybe the network is not available.
if you are in China, please use a VPN.
```

[issue 44](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/44)

```
failed to download videos, maybe the network is not available.
if you are in China, please use a VPN.
```

This is likely due to network issues preventing access to foreign services. Please use a VPN to resolve this.

### ‚ùìImageMagick is not installed on your computer

[issue 33](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/33)

1. Follow the `example configuration` provided `download address` to
   install https://imagemagick.org/archive/binaries/ImageMagick-7.1.1-30-Q16-x64-static.exe, using the static library
2. Do not install in a path with Chinese characters to avoid unpredictable issues

[issue 54](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/54#issuecomment-2017842022)

For Linux systems, you can manually install it, refer to https://cn.linux-console.net/?p=16978

Thanks to [@wangwenqiao666](https://github.com/wangwenqiao666) for their research and exploration

### ‚ùìImageMagick's security policy prevents operations related to temporary file @/tmp/tmpur5hyyto.txt

You can find these policies in ImageMagick's configuration file policy.xml.
This file is usually located in /etc/ImageMagick-`X`/ or a similar location in the ImageMagick installation directory.
Modify the entry containing `pattern="@"`, change `rights="none"` to `rights="read|write"` to allow read and write operations on files.

### ‚ùìOSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files

This issue is caused by the system's limit on the number of open files. You can solve it by modifying the system's file open limit.

Check the current limit:

```shell
ulimit -n
```

If it's too low, you can increase it, for example:

```shell
ulimit -n 10240
```

### ‚ùìWhisper model download failed, with the following error

LocalEntryNotfoundEror: Cannot find an appropriate cached snapshotfolderfor the specified revision on the local disk and
outgoing trafic has been disabled.
To enablerepo look-ups and downloads online, pass 'local files only=False' as input.
